# Mobile Devices Database

This is my first approach to the relational database model. 

A small two-person project that contains several tables linked together by relationships.

To create the project we used PostgreSQL, DBeaver as SQL client and Oracle SQL Developer to generate the relationship diagram .

**All of the data such as addresses, names, phone numbers and device serial numbers from the DML script were randomly generated using random data generators available on the web.**
